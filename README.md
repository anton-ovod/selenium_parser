# Selenium Python Parser

This repository contains a Python parser built with Selenium. It allows you to automate web scraping and data extraction tasks using the Selenium framework.

## Features

- Web scraping: Extract data from websites by automating interactions with web pages.
- Data extraction: Parse HTML elements, extract text, attributes, or perform complex scraping operations.
- Flexible and customizable: Modify the parser to suit your specific needs and target different websites.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Run the parser on various operating systems where Python and Selenium are supported.

## Requirements

To use the Selenium Python parser, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Selenium library (install using `pip install selenium`)
- Web driver for your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install selenium
   ```
2. Download the appropriate web driver for your browser and operating system. Make sure the web driver executable is in your system's PATH.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/anton-ovod/selenium_parser.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
